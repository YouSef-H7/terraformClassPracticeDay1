this is a terraform workflow to create a resource group and container registry. We're going to practice some practical scripting.

Why do we need container registry? To store our docker images and pull them instantly in other workflows using docker.

Instructions class practice:

1. review the code and complete the scripts where it says " complete the following block"
2. to check if  syntax is working run: terrafom validate
3. once ready run : terraform plan, and terraform apply to deploy workflow.
4. ask teachers if you need assistance.
5. be careful to know what you are building because we will use this for the next exercise.
6. Once you complete it please let the teacher know.
7. remember to creare a .gitignore to keep these files from commiting:
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
